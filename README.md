# Neural Network – Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a Neural Network from scratch using NumPy
to recognize handwritten digits (0–9).

## Features
- Forward Propagation
- Backward Propagation
- Gradient Descent Training
- Softmax Classification

## Dataset
MNIST handwritten digit dataset (28×28 images)

## Results
- Training Accuracy: ~99%
- Test Accuracy: ~87%

## Run
Open `Neural_Network_Project.ipynb` in Google Colab and run all cells.
